# Adaptive Math Prototype


A minimal adaptive math practice prototype (console app) that demonstrates:


- 3 difficulty levels: Easy / Medium / Hard
- Adaptive engine that automatically adjusts difficulty based on performance
- Logging of user responses and difficulty transitions


## Included files like:


- `src/puzzle_generator.py` — generates math puzzles by difficulty
- `src/tracker.py` — logs responses, correctness, time and writes a CSV
- `src/adaptive_engine.py` — rule-based and optional ML-based adaptive logic
- `src/main.py` — console-driven session runner (10-question session)
